          <p>That's not simply a matter of policy or ideology - it's a moral commitment. And there's another issue we must confront as well. We all put our country first. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind, heart, and soul.</p>
          <p>But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities which are also threatened. So let me be clear: no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other.</p>
          <p>She had this enormous capacity for wonder, and lived by the Golden Rule. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts - that out of many, we are truly one.</p>
          <p>It is not up in heaven. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p>
          <p>His values - and his record - affirm what is best in us. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth and carrying out His works. That won't keep America safe. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings.</p>
          <p>God bless you.</p>
          <p>Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing!</p>
          <p>They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. Well that's easy to remember. 0118 999 88199 9119 725! ... 3!</p>
          <p>Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on.</p>
          <p>I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality. From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! Graphic homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? How long have you been disabled? Ten years? Ten years, and how did it happen? If that's not a rude question. Acid?</p>
          <p><a id="bookmark1" href="">bookmark 1</a> Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble.</p>
